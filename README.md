  - **About Section**: A brief introduction to Mixify's purpose and vision.  
  - **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section**: Encourages users to dive into the app's capabilities.  
  - **Responsive Navbar**: A burger menu for seamless navigation on smaller screens.  

- **Features Hub**:  
  - Acts as a central dashboard for exploring Mixify's planned capabilities. Features are represented as square tiles styled like Spotify cover images, ready to guide users to future implementations.

### Responsive Layout
- The app is fully optimized for devices of all sizes, dynamically adapting its layout to ensure an intuitive user experience.  
- Grids seamlessly adjust between different configurations.

### Light Mode & Dark Mode
Mixify features both **light mode** and **dark mode** interfaces. The app dynamically switches between these modes based on user preferences, using CSS variables to define colors for each theme. This ensures a consistent and smooth user experience across different lighting conditions.

### Planned Features
The roadmap includes:
1. **User Insights & Analytics**
2. **Playlist Creation & Management**
3. **Collaboration & Social Features**
4. **Media Playback**
